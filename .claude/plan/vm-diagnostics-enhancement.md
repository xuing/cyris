# VM Diagnostics Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Implement intelligent VM diagnostics system with minimal code intrusion, automatically detecting issues and providing user-friendly suggestions.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Detection Functions
1. Create VM diagnostics module (`vm_diagnostics.py`)
2. Implement key detection functions:
   - Image integrity check
   - Cloud-init configuration validation
   - Real VM startup status check
   - Network diagnostics
   - VM startup logs extraction

### Phase 2: Smart Detection Integration
3. Enhance `cyris status` command with auto-diagnostics
4. Enhance `cyris list` command with health indicators
5. Enhance `cyris create` command with pre/post checks

### Phase 3: User Experience Optimization
6. Standardized problem messages and solutions
7. Integrate common virsh functionality

## Architecture
- New files: 2 (~300 lines)
- Modified files: 3 (~50 lines addition)
- Core logic: Unchanged, diagnostics only on exceptions
- Backward compatibility: 100%

## Expected User Experience
- Automatic problem detection in existing commands
- Friendly error messages with actionable solutions
- Zero learning curve for users
