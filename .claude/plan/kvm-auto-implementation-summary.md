# kvm-auto Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented `kvm-auto` basevm_type that enables automatic VM creation using virt-builder + virt-install, eliminating the need for pre-built templates.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Domain Entity Extension (`src/cyris/domain/entities/guest.py`)
- ✅ Added `KVM_AUTO = "kvm-auto"` to `BaseVMType` enum
- ✅ Added kvm-auto specific fields: `image_name`, `vcpus`, `memory`, `disk_size`
- ✅ Made `basevm_host` and `basevm_config_file` optional for kvm-auto
- ✅ Auto-derive `basevm_os_type` from `image_name` with smart mapping
- ✅ Comprehensive validation with clear error messages
- ✅ Updated `GuestBuilder` to support new fields

### 2. Local Image Builder Service (`src/cyris/infrastructure/image_builder.py`)
- ✅ `LocalImageBuilder` class for virt-builder operations
- ✅ Build workflow: virt-builder → virt-customize (tasks) → distribute
- ✅ Support for build-time execution of `add_account`/`modify_account` tasks
- ✅ Dependency checking for virt-builder, virt-customize, virt-install
- ✅ Image validation against `virt-builder --list`
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of build artifacts

### 3. KVM Provider Enhancement (`src/cyris/infrastructure/providers/kvm_provider.py`)
- ✅ Enhanced `create_guests()` to route kvm-auto guests to new workflow
- ✅ Group guests by image config to avoid duplicate builds
- ✅ `_create_kvm_auto_guests()` method for full workflow
- ✅ `_create_vm_with_virt_install()` for VM creation
- ✅ Build image locally → copy to final location → create VM with virt-install
- ✅ Proper resource tracking and metadata

### 4. Configuration Parser (`src/cyris/config/parser.py`)
- ✅ Added `kvm-auto` to basevm_type mapping
- ✅ Conditional field handling for kvm-auto vs regular guests
- ✅ Parse kvm-auto specific fields from YAML
- ✅ Maintain original tasks structure parsing

### 5. CLI Validation (`src/cyris/cli/commands/create_command.py`)
- ✅ `_check_kvm_auto_requirements()` method in pre-creation checks
- ✅ Validate virt-builder, virt-customize, virt-install availability  
- ✅ Validate image names against `virt-builder --list`
- ✅ Display helpful error messages and installation guidance
- ✅ Show configuration examples when validation fails

## Configuration Example

```yaml
guest_settings:
  - id: ubuntu-desktop
    basevm_type: kvm-auto           # New type
    image_name: ubuntu-20.04        # Auto-derives basevm_os_type
    vcpus: 2
    memory: 2048
    disk_size: 20G
    tasks:                          # Original structure preserved
    - add_account:
      - account: trainee
        passwd: training123
    - modify_account:
      - account: root
        new_passwd: newpass
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Smart OS Detection**
- Automatically derives `basevm_os_type` from `image_name`
- Mapping: `ubuntu-20.04` → `OSType.UBUNTU_20`
- Supports Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora images

### 2. **Build-Time Task Execution**
- Executes `add_account` and `modify_account` during image building
- Uses `virt-customize` to modify images before VM creation
- Maintains original YAML task structure

### 3. **Efficient Image Management**
- Groups guests by identical image configurations
- Avoids rebuilding same image multiple times
- Automatic cleanup of temporary build files

### 4. **Comprehensive Validation**
- Pre-flight checks for required tools
- Image name validation against available images
- Clear error messages with installation guidance
- Configuration examples for user guidance

### 5. **Multi-Host Support Ready**
- Built images can be distributed to target hosts
- Target hosts only need virt-install (not virt-builder)
- Build happens on current machine, distribute via scp

## Workflow

1. **Parse Configuration**: Identify kvm-auto guests and validate fields
2. **Pre-Creation Checks**: Validate tool availability and image names
3. **Local Build**: Use virt-builder to create base image
4. **Task Execution**: Execute add_account/modify_account with virt-customize
5. **VM Creation**: Copy image and create VM with virt-install --import
6. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary build files

## Dependencies

### Required Tools
- `virt-builder` - Base image creation from templates
- `virt-customize` - Image modification for tasks
- `virt-install` - VM creation and management

### Installation
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libguestfs-tools virtinst

# CentOS/RHEL  
sudo yum install libguestfs-tools virt-install
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Configuration Parsing
- YAML with kvm-auto guests parsed correctly
- Required fields validated (image_name, vcpus, memory, disk_size)
- Tasks structure preserved and parsed correctly

### ✅ Tool Detection
- Correctly identifies available/missing tools
- Provides appropriate installation guidance
- Shows clear error messages for missing dependencies

### ✅ Validation Logic
- Pre-creation checks work as expected
- Image name validation against virt-builder list
- User-friendly error messages and examples

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Regular `kvm` guests continue to work unchanged
- No impact on existing configurations
- Clean separation between kvm-auto and regular workflows

## Benefits

1. **No Template Dependency**: Eliminates need for pre-built VM templates
2. **Automatic Setup**: Users created during build phase, ready on first boot
3. **Image Variety**: Access to full virt-builder image library
4. **Resource Efficient**: Only builds images once per configuration
5. **User Friendly**: Clear validation and helpful error messages
6. **Flexible**: Supports same task types as regular VMs

## Implementation Quality

- **SOLID Principles**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with clear messages  
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files
- **Performance**: Efficient image grouping and reuse
- **Maintainable**: Well-structured code with proper abstractions
- **User Experience**: Helpful guidance and examples

The implementation successfully provides a seamless way to create VMs without requiring pre-built templates, while maintaining full compatibility with existing functionality.
