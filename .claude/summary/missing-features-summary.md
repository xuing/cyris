# CyRIS Missing Features Summary

**Summary Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Assessment Type**: Complete Legacy vs Modern Feature Comparison  

## 🚨 Major Missing Features Identified

### 1. **Parallel Base Image Distribution** (CRITICAL)
**Issue ID**: CYRIS-2025-001  
**Impact**: Multi-host deployment capability completely lost  

**Legacy Had**:
- Automatic `parallel-scp` distribution to multiple hosts
- Smart host filtering (skip localhost)
- Concurrent transfer with configurable concurrency (50 connections)
- Intelligent base image synchronization

**Modern Missing**:
- No multi-host base image distribution
- Limited to single-host deployments only
- Multi-host environments require manual image pre-positioning

**Business Impact**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Cannot scale to distributed training environments

---

### 2. **Automatic Random User Account Generation** (HIGH)
**Issue ID**: CYRIS-2025-002  
**Impact**: User experience regression, deployment complexity increase  

**Legacy Had**:
- Zero-configuration trainee account creation (`trainee01`, `trainee02`, etc.)
- Automatic 10-character random password generation per instance
- Post-VM creation account setup integration
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux)

**Modern Missing**:
- No automatic user generation workflow
- Requires manual YAML configuration for every trainee account
- No random credential generation integrated into deployment
- Entry point detection exists but no action taken

**Business Impact**: 🟡 **HIGH** - Significantly increases setup complexity for training environments

## 🔍 Now Investigating: Network Topology Layer 3 Configuration

### Research Question
> "Network topology configuration between cloned VMs takes place at Layer 3, via IP address based routing through firewall rules"

**Need to verify**:
- Is Layer 3 routing between VMs implemented?
- Are firewall rules automatically configured for network topology?
- Does the modern system maintain network isolation and routing?

## 🎯 Priority Assessment

### Priority 1 (Critical - Immediate Action Required)
1. **Fix LIBVIRT_AVAILABLE undefined variable** - Blocking VM creation
2. **Parallel Base Image Distribution** - Restore multi-host capability
3. **clone_vm Integration** - ✅ **FIXED** - Now working correctly

### Priority 2 (High - Next Sprint)  
1. **Automatic User Account Generation** - Restore UX parity with legacy
2. **Network Topology Layer 3** - Under investigation

### Priority 3 (Medium - Future)
1. Enhanced monitoring and status reporting
2. Performance optimization
3. Enhanced error handling and recovery
